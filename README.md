# ClimbLog
A lightweight web app that helps climbers track and log their sessions and visualize their progress across grades, styles, and attempts.

## Why I Built This
As a climber, I wanted a simple way to track sessions and understand progress without the pressure and confusion of large social climbing platforms. This project was built to focus on clarity, fast logging, and meaningful tracking insights.

## Features
- Log climbing session with grade, style, attempts, and result
- View session history in a clean dashboard layout
- Filter sessions by date, discipline, and result
- See summary statistics such as send rate and highest grade
- Persistent client-side storage using localStorage


## Tech Stack 
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScrit
- Browser localStorage for data persistence
- No frameworks or libraries used
